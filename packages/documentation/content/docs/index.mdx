## Introduction

Parlance Grid is __100% canvas-driven__, __MIT-licensed__, __fully-typed__ datagrid for React that handles millions of rows while staying easy to shape to your needs.

The package is built with two principles in mind:
1. __Performance__ - The grid should be able to handle millions of rows while staying performant.
2. __Customization__ - The grid should be easy to shape to your needs.

To achieve this, the package architecture is designed to be highly modular with a strong separation of concerns, allowing the developer to hook into the grid at any layer and extend it to their needs. The Parlance Grid architecture consists of the following 4 modules:

<Card icon={<AtomIcon className="text-blue-300" />} title='React Canvas Component'>

This is the core component that includes the canvas element, and orchestrates the communication between the other modules.

</Card>

<Card icon={<CpuIcon className="text-orange-300" />} title='State Engine'>

The state engine is responsible for managing the state of the grid, including scrolling, selections, interactions, and data-fetching.

</Card>

<Card icon={<LayoutDashboardIcon className="text-green-300" />} title='Layout Engine'>

The layout engine is responsible for calculating the position and size of the cells, and the visible range of the grid, along with other layout-related calculations.

</Card>

<Card icon={<BrushIcon className="text-teal-300" />} title='Rendering Engine'>

The rendering engine uses the layout engine's output to render the grid to the canvas, with overrides at every stage of the rendering process.
